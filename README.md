# Proxies

Reverse Proxy is when the client doesnt know who they are sending the request to. 
Is it sending request to a remote server or if there is a proxy deployed between the client and server. Client has no idea. 


Forward Proxy is when the server doesnt know who it is receiving requests from. It can be either a proxy or the actual client itself. ( Most of the cases its proxy which routes the requests)


Engine - X  ( nginx ) does a very good job of acting as a proxy in most of the production applications.
